About
Hi, I'm BK. I'm a Software Engineer at [Anaplan](https://anaplan.com/). Most recently I was a Senior Software Engineer at [Sigma Digital](https://www.sigmadigital.io/), and a GIS Developer at [RAMM Technologies](https://www.ramm.co.za/) and [ESRI South Africa](https://www.esri-southafrica.com/). I was born and bred in Zimbabwe and I worked there for four years before moving to South Africa and then the UK.

I really love [writing about stuff I learn](https://www.bhekani.com/) and [making videos about it](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrapMy2k4JqoOkATDI_lexw). In 2021 I'd love to create more content and [learn in public](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579).

In a past life I was a Civil and Water Engineer, and I often like to draw parallels between tech and then traditional engineering disciplines.
